App for bookmarking your favorite repositories from Github. You can save your favorite repositories on a list and open them to see their issue history.
The app is made with React using styled-components and react-router-dom. All the data is retrieved from the Github API (https://api.github.com/).
As there is no back-end and therefore no data base, the bookmarks are being stored in localStorage.
